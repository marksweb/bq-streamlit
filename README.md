# bq-streamlit

A test to get BigQuery data in a streamlit app.

Currently not running with Big Query but able to query tavily using GPT with Pydantic AI models.

Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and add your OpenAI and Tavily API keys.

To run, use uv to install dependencies and run `streamlit run app.py`
